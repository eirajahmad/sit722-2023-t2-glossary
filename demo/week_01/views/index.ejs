        <tr>
            <td>DevOps</td>
            <td>DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that aims to improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, fostering a more efficient and automated software development and deployment process.</td>
            <td>DevOps promotes the idea of breaking down traditional silos between development and operations, enabling a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and using tools and automation to achieve faster, more reliable, and frequent software releases.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Continuous Integration (CI)</td>
            <td>Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated build and testing processes.</td>
            <td>The main goal of CI is to detect integration issues early in the development cycle, ensuring that code changes can be smoothly integrated into the main codebase and reducing the risk of conflicts. CI helps maintain a consistent and reliable development workflow, leading to more frequent and reliable software releases.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Continuous Deployment (CD)</td>
            <td>Continuous Deployment is an extension of continuous integration, where every code change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production environments.</td>
            <td>CD aims to make the release process automated and seamless, allowing for rapid and frequent deployments with minimal manual intervention. It requires a high degree of test automation and confidence in the codebase to ensure that changes can be safely deployed without causing disruptions to users.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</td>
            <td>Infrastructure as Code refers to the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (servers, networks, etc.) through machine-readable definition files rather than manual configuration.</td>
            <td>With IaC, infrastructure setups can be version-controlled and treated like software code, enabling reproducibility, consistency, and scalability. This approach reduces the risk of configuration drift and facilitates collaboration between development and operations teams, as both can work with the same codebase to manage infrastructure changes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Docker</td>
            <td>Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.</td>
            <td>Containers provide a consistent and isolated environment, ensuring that applications run reliably regardless of the underlying system. Docker allows for easy deployment and scalability, making it a popular choice for containerization, a key component of microservices-based architectures.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kubernetes</td>
            <td>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</td>
            <td>Kubernetes provides a robust set of features for container scheduling, load balancing, service discovery, and self-healing, making it easier to manage and scale containerized applications in dynamic environments. It has become the de facto standard for managing container workloads in production.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Git</td>
            <td>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a codebase simultaneously.</td>
            <td>Git tracks changes to source code over time, enables branching and merging workflows, and provides a complete history of a project's development. It facilitates collaboration, reduces conflicts, and helps ensure that code changes are properly reviewed before integration. Git is widely used and forms the foundation for many code hosting platforms like GitHub and GitLab.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jenkins</td>
            <td>Jenkins is an open-source automation server that supports continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines.</td>
            <td>Jenkins enables developers to automate build, test, and deployment processes. It integrates with various tools and services, providing flexibility in building complex CI/CD workflows. Jenkins is highly extensible through plugins, making it a popular choice for automating various tasks in the DevOps ecosystem.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ansible</td>
            <td>Ansible is an open-source configuration management and automation tool that allows developers to define infrastructure as code through declarative YAML files.</td>
            <td>Ansible automates the process of setting up and configuring systems, making it easier to manage infrastructure and applications at scale. With Ansible, developers can describe the desired state of the system, and the tool takes care of bringing the system to that state, simplifying repetitive tasks and reducing human error. It is agentless and relies on SSH for communication, making it easy to get started and suitable for various use cases.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Monitoring</td>
            <td>Monitoring in the context of DevOps refers to the practice of observing and gathering data from various components of a system to ensure its health, performance, and availability.</td>
            <td>Monitoring involves the use of specialized tools and systems to collect metrics, logs, and other relevant data, which are analyzed to detect issues, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions for improving the overall system performance and reliability. Monitoring is crucial for maintaining a stable production environment and enabling proactive responses to potential problems before they become critical.</td>
